# Super Pedobear Proxy
This is for server owners who wants to use [Super Pedobear](https://github.com/Xperidia/SuperPedobear) under the most popular, broad and global gamemode category of "Pedobear".

It's like a "proxy", it allows you to load [Super Pedobear](https://github.com/Xperidia/SuperPedobear) under the "pedo" gamemode id without actually modifying/impacting the original [Super Pedobear](https://github.com/Xperidia/SuperPedobear) gamemode.

It's also on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1812996750), if you want to put it in your server collection.

This repository can also be used as a base for your [Super Pedobear](https://github.com/Xperidia/SuperPedobear) modding.
